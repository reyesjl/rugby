00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now, if he's 320 pounds Samoan and he sees this, he's got one job to do, okay?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You want to stay square to where you're going here right now, so you've got a pass.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You don't have to look at him. You can smell him. You can feel him. You can hear him.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He's making noise on the ground. He's right there. Remember, he's a meter away from you.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You just have to make sure it's not a forward pass, and it's delivered just with enough power,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
or lack of power, to make sure that he receives that ball.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So add that to your skills. You're hitting your lane.
