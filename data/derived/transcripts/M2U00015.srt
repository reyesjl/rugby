1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
And we're talking about just receiving point, point, point.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,600
That's really all it is, because we're not really running anymore.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,360
The hands are doing the running, and the ball is taking flight.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,060
And it's in a grid of about 6-7 metres.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,580
I'm not saying that we're butchering it, but we're getting used to it.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,580
I'm running you through all the coaching points on how to do this

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,120
before we expand this a little bit.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,580
Alright, we'll go for another set.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,520
Questions?

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,760
These boys are doing f***ing...

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,800
Holding, holding, holding.

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,560
Stay square, stay square, stay square.

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,400
Hold on.

14
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,760
You guys on the end, fall in behind here.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,000
Fall in behind here, so we're only going to have 5.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Ready?

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,760
That's it, Ricky.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,180
Get right here.

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:09,620
Good.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,800
Nice.

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,680
Come on, come on, come on.

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,360
Yep.

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,980
Nice.

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,320
Nice.

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,520
Nice.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,940
Look at your но.

27
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:49,580
Nice.

28
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
It's beautiful against the wind.

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,680
Nice.

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,180
Nice.

31
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,620
Nice.

32
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,080
Nice.

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,400
Nice.

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,840
Good one.

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,240
I'm over. Good. Okay.

36
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,840
Go that way.

37
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,640
Free me to pass.
