1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Poor shit.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Seals, what drives them?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
They always have a plan.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And if the plan goes to shit, guess what they have?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Not a good plan.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So in a game like this, where you've got this and you're striking and you're coming down,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
you've got to get across, you've got a goal, you've got an objective, you have a plan.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey listen, if it comes to me, I'm going to pass it to you, I'm going to give it to him.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm all too, but hey, run towards the orange shorts

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because I think there's a little bit of a gap there.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Plan.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It could be as, on a rugby field, when you take your girlfriend out for a fucking night out,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
there's a plan, isn't there?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Because if there isn't, there's no fucking hoochie-coochie after the movie.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm putting that foot in the field.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Have a plan.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, last one.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's get a duck.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's have...

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Get it, Frank.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll put him over here.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Can I clear up there for that one?

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Here, Coy, let me get a shot of you.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Did you have a perk on, or what?

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, you did.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Right here.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Put a player here, one here, one here, one there, and on that yellow turn.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's the thumbnail.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So, four players on each turn here, and then four players on the other side.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,100
And that's it.
