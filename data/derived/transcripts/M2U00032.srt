1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
A very good reason, I want to share it.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
USA Radio is in the shit right now.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It has been for 30 odd years I've been involved with it.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And I've tried at every level as an administrator to try and get some sort of semblance.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And I work for a professional organization and I see professionalism a whole different sort of way.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
To be a good professional you have to be a very, very good amateur.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What we're doing here tonight is extremely amateur.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
A hotbed of USA rugby was this club rugby.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And it was really, really strong in the 70s and 80s.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It was awesome.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The tournaments, there would be teams from the UK, from Australia, from everywhere.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
They'd want to play the Chicago Lions or the Belmont Shore or Nova or whatever.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The Washington Rugby Club.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We don't get those tours anymore because of professionalism.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And it's kind of waning.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So how do we get our clubs strong?

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Through recruiting, through staying vigilant.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Being very, very good amateurs turns you into a professional.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Does that make sense?

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're not going to get any better.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Scott Lawrence is in our coaching group.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And the Eagles are improving slowly.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But I could have retired from this years ago.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But I'm still kind of going because I've got a lot of experience and I like to share it.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I like to become that really amateur coach on a Tuesday night in the middle of wherever we are.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
With new players, with the two older players.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And that's really the heart-beater of rugby as a tribute.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll leave it there.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But I think it's just how important it is to be a really proud of the club and your teammates.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And as you go into your fall season.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Jose will challenge me on schoolwork and things to improve upon.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
As you guys start picking up on that.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Start picking up music before you get into it.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's what's driving me right now.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's why an old shit like this drives an hour out of the Shenandoah Valley to come into town.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Which I fucking love.
