1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
on the field for their moves and everything they thought this was the most comfortable

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,880
to be able to now it's um now it's seven which is here why defenses are more spread out

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,520
they're taking up more real estate on the field through high balls and different attack approaches

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,640
which is fine so so from here my i'm relying on my mechanics here to be able to get that ball

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,280
where it needs to get to okay so we're going to do three meters a three meter pass here

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,360
which is right here just so you guys know none of tony's fingers work and his passes

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,120
his pass is absolutely perfect because of the technique you can you can practice on your thing
