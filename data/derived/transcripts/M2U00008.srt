1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's like this.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's like past like this.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's like past like this.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's 6 out of 10.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're not saving out of 10 or getting anything out of it.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's like that.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They'll get to it, they go.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But because of 4, or not knowing how you're holding the ball,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
what's driving the ball, what things are important,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
what things are useless.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay, the other 3 are like this.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Alright, so we're going to get into this bill over here.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's going to be shorter.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's only 1 meter.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's like this.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's how the past is going to be.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's really cool.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's like this.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We get really catching the ball.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And we get to the room in the ball.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And try and get the train load from here.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I mean, when we extend it a little bit.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So you're here.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And the ball hits the mark all the time.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You see the chance they're doing the target that you hit.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, you don't have to get all.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's not easy on the 70s.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The square, because this guy wants to take my hit off here.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm here.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm going to square it to my van.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Come again.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And we're not following the class.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not following him.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Because he'll kill me.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Because he sees this.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Alright, that's easy.

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's just an ambush credit sign.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Alright, push it on that.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Tony, this C rib.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
C rib, deep rib.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, they caught.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yep, I like that.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I just learned something today.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
A question's on it.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Anybody having trouble with their passing?

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We're having trouble passing one way.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Tony.

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's okay.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Can you go to see what it's doing?

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And you're going to break this.

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You've got to understand the mechanics of the just a ball.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And help how it's going to get there.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How you can get that power.

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And just come off later.

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Right.

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If I wanted to get your head.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Think it's going up to the head.

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Just what I just made.

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll coach that.

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Right.

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I want to go to text.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll talk down here.

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Right.

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm a little bit congested.

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Because I'm short.

67
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And he's just gave me that right.

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
To be.

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So when the buffalo is coming to get me.

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll get the pass away.

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And I'm already kind of really firm.

72
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thanks.

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thanks.

74
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Thank you.

75
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you.

76
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you.

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you.

78
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll put Drake.

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And we're over to.

80
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you.
