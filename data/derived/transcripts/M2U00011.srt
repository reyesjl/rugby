1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,460
And I've got it figured out.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,160
And then they grow like this.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,640
It's a lot of contentious chat.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,000
Is it a pip or is it a pop?

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,980
Because the pass is a little bit too narrow.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,040
And they tee off on each other.

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,200
Why? Because they tend.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,440
And they generally have good points.

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,080
If they're not receiving the pass

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,820
and they're not delivering the pass,

11
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,260
it's an issue.

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,380
Because in a game you're going to get it. You'll get one of those.

13
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,280
And that's what we don't want to coach.

14
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,980
This drill here, you're going to come through.

15
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,620
And this player here

16
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,480
starts here, he stands here

17
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,640
and the ball goes right here.

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,600
Point, point, point, point, point.

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,300
You hit this cone.

20
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,920
Sweep around.

21
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,820
Sweep around.

22
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:42,960
Sweep around.

23
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,880
And sweep around.

24
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:45,740
Okay?

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,420
And then you guys just come in

26
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,520
and you'll be closer, closer.

27
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,260
Okay?

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,340
What are a couple things that we can do

29
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:55,540
to
