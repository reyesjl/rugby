1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
on the field for their moves and everything they thought this was the most comfortable

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:11,000
to be able to now it's um now it's seven which is here why defense is more spread out

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,480
they're taking up more real estate on the field through high balls and different attack approaches

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,760
which is fine so so from here my i'm relying on my mechanics here to be able to get that ball

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,420
where it needs to get to it okay so we're going to do three meters a three meter pass here

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:39,200
which is right here just so you guys know none of tony's fingers fucking work and his passes

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,180
his pass is absolutely perfect because of the technique you can you can practice on your thing

8
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,580
like this it's square to you if you want to take my head off i got i got eyes on you i know you

Switch.

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,700
Back here.

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,720
Now take a step.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,700
Look at, it's good there, it's good.

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,940
You might see my target hands, I see your hands here.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,780
See that, Frank?

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,620
Target.

21
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,640
Nice.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,740
Again, here we go, they're coming.

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,580
Square.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,760
You can do that on your own, okay?

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,940
I'd much rather you do this than everybody's like,

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,280
you know, and yeah, you know,

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,320
there's a little bit of pussy on Saturday night,

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,160
so yeah.

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,760
Bit of a drop late news, so you know, yeah.

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,140
Okay?

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,320
Mark out three meters.

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,320
It's nail 10, nail 10 here, nail 10 here.

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,540
Okay?

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,380
I'm gonna flick my wrist there now,

35
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,780
because I'm guessing they're strong.

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,620
I'm gonna get their balls.

37
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,540
I don't need to, I don't need to spin it.

38
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,980
I just need to get the ball into his hands, all right?

39
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,280
Now I'm gonna look at you.

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,820
Let's see if it gets you.

41
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,180
Okay.

42
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,020
Get it?

43
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,860
Yeah.

44
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,700
Fuck.

45
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,520
I know best, you're supposed to say,

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,400
not best, but not best.

47
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,220
Oh, shit.

48
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,060
Okay.
