1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
And we're talking about just receiving point, point, point.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,600
That's really all it is, because we're not really running anywhere.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,360
The hands are doing the running, and the ball is taking flight.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,060
And it's in a grid of about 6-7 meters.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,600
I'm not saying that we're butchering it, but we're getting used to it.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,600
I'm running you through all the coaching points on how to do this

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,120
before we expand this a little bit.

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,580
Alright, we'll go for another set.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,520
Questions?

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,800
Holding, holding, holding.

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,580
Stay square, stay square, stay square.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,760
Hold on. You guys on the end, fall in behind here.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,000
Fall in behind here, so we're only going to have five.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,820
Ready?

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,800
That's it, Ricky.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,640
Get right here. Good.

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,820
Nice.

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,740
Good.

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,380
Yep.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
Nice.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,040
Good.

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,320
Nice.

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:41,600
Look at your cone, Look at your channel.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,960
What's your channel?

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,000
Yep.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,100
Nice!

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,120
Get it, get it, get it.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,640
Nice, Rob.

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,880
Come back.

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,140
Hold on.

31
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,140
Yeah, that'll cover.

32
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,640
Good.

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,140
OK.

34
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,140
Go that way.

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,140
A three-meter pass.

36
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,140
Yeah.
