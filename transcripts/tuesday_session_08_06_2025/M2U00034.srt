1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, I saw the thing with your trip, the one where you guys were like dancing naked in the pool.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
No, no, you gotta look at the other ones, there's more.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh, this light is too good.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I didn't know Campbell wasn't doing much, y'all.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yeah, he's been there.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh yeah, really?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
How much have you had to drink, Brendan?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Your pupils are dilated, is it because of the light?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
When should we have a sleepover at your house tonight?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We, uh, we played...

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We should have a sleepover at, uh...

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's up?

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What'd you think of that?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's pretty crazy.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Dude, uh...

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, outro, outro, outro.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Exiles out!

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Exiles out.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Do it again, do it again.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Second cut, second cut.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Alright, second cut, second cut.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Cut two, cut two.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What do I say?

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Just say, exiles out.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That was sick.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Exiles out!
