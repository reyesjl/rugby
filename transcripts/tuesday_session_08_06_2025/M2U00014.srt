1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
This is what I do, just watch me, I'm like this, here, bang, it's on.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,380
You don't have to get in here and wait until you see him because then it screws up.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,680
With you on, with you on.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:11,980
Ready?

00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:13,900
Yeah, right here.

00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,340
Good.

00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,140
Yeah, right here.

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,840
Yeah, right here.

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:20,480
Yeah, right here.

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,520
Okay.

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,920
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

14
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,080
Look, look, look, look.

15
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:24,780
Check, check, check.

16
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,180
Ah, turn, turn.

17
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,480
Ah.

18
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,340
No, no, it's like us, yep.

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,580
It's a shit pass.

20
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,060
It's a shit pass.

21
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,480
But he knows that.

22
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,620
He needs to hear it from you.

23
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:34,980
All right.

24
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,380
Okay?

25
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,940
I'll get it right next time.

26
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,680
Hey, that was a shit pass.

27
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,940
I'll get it next time.

28
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,600
Great, we're on now.

29
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:42,720
Holding.

30
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,880
Hey, that was a pass, that wasn't a pop.

31
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,220
Those tens had a bit on you.

32
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:51,720
I don't know what I did.

33
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,660
Yeah, it's here.

34
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,100
Here we go.

35
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,180
Guys, we're ready.

36
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,980
Get your tents.

37
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey, look, make sure they're ready.

38
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,680
Front foot, front foot low.

39
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
Wear your hands.

40
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
Ready.

41
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Oh, that was a pass.

00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
The tens would have been all over you, man.

44
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
The airframe.

45
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
Yeah, I'm with you.

46
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
Tighter.

00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Good.

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,680
Better.

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Yeah.

53
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Here we go.

54
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
Come on.

55
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,680
Good.

56
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Oh.

Tighter.

62
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Good.

63
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
Right here.

64
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
Good.

65
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Good.

66
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,620
All the time.
