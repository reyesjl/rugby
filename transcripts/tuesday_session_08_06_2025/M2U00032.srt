1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
A very good reason, I want to share it.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
USA Rabies is in the shit right now.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It has been for 30 odd years I've been involved with it.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And I've tried at every level as an administrator

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to try and get some sort of semblance.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And I work for a professional organization

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and I see professionalism

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
in a whole different sort of way.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
To be a good professional you have to be a very, very good amateur.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What we're doing here tonight is extremely amateur.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A hotbed of USA Rabies was this club, Rabies.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And it was really, really strong in the 70s and 80s. It was awesome.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The tournaments, there would be teams from the UK,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
from Australia, from everywhere. They'd want to play the Chicago Lions

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
or the Belmont Shore

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
or Nova or Washington Rugby Club.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We don't get those tours anymore because of professionalism.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And it's kind of waning.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So how do we get our clubs strong?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Through recruiting, through staying vigilant.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Being very, very good amateurs

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
turns you into a professional.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Does that make sense?

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And that's all that we have.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're not going to get any better.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Scott Lawrence is in our coaching group.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The Eagles are improving slowly.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But, you know,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I could have retired from this years ago.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But I'm still kind of going because I've got a lot of experience.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And I like to share it.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And I like to become that really amateur coach

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
on a Tuesday night

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
in the middle of wherever we are

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
with new players,

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
with the two older players.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And that's really the heartbeat of rugby

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and as a tribute.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll leave it there.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But I think it's just how important it is

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
to be a really proud of the club

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and your teammates.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And as you go into your fall season,

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Jose will challenge me on schoolwork

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and things to improve upon

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
as you guys start picking up

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
years before you get into it.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's what's driving me right now.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's why an old shit like this

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
drives an hour

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
out of the Shenandoah Valley

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
to come into town,

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
which I fucking love.
