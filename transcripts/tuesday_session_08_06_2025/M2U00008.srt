1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,440
If I pass like this, if I pass like this, if I pass like this, 6 out of 10, well 7 out of 10 will get where they're going.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,120
I'll pass like that, they'll get to it, there you go.

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:25,040
But because of poor foreball not knowing how you're holding the ball, what's driving the ball, what things are important, what things are useless.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,660
Okay, the other three are like this, or here comes someone.

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,840
Alright, so we're going to get into this bill over here, and it's going to be short, it's only one metre, so the passes are going to be just really poor.

6
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,120
So focus on where you're catching the ball, and where you're delivering the ball.

7
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:53,800
And try and load from here, when we expand a little bit, so you're here, and the ball hits the mark all the time.

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,020
See if you can.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,820
Yeah, you don't have to get all, like what we used to do in the 70s.

10
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,120
You're squared, because this guy wants to take my head off here.

11
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,380
So I'm here, and I'm squared to my man, come again, and we're not following the pass.

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,760
See, I'm not following him, because he'll kill me if he sees this.

13
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,580
Alright, and that's easy, that's just ambush predator.

14
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,420
Alright, questions on that?

15
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,000
Tony, there's...

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,700
See real...

17
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,700
See ribs, eat ribs.

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,880
Is that what they call it?

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,220
Yep, I like that.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,360
I just learned something today.

21
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,380
Questions on that?

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,240
Anybody having trouble with their passing, or having trouble passing one way?

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,360
On you.

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,140
It's okay?

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,140
Okay, you've got to do it, and you've got to practice it, you've got to understand the mechanics of it.

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,880
It's just a ball, and how it's going to get there, how you can get that power and accuracy.

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:00,880
And just come off, right, if I want to hit your head, fingers are going up to the head.

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,880
That's what I, that's just me, I'll coach that, alright, if I want it to go to his hips, I'll point down here.

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,880
Alright, I'm a little bit congested, because I'm short, and Jesus gave me that right to be.

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,880
So when the buffaloes are coming to get me, I'll get the pass away, and I'm already kind of ready for impact, versus the tall timber.

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,720
Because if they have balls, I'm ready to go.

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
Alright .

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,780
Now a quick drink.
