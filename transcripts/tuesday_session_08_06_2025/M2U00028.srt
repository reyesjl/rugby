1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
No questions?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You boys ready?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You ready?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey, you're fuckin' ready, eh?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Eh? I can tell.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're fuckin' on.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There we go.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Steady. Holding.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Right here.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Move.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yup.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Go. Pick it up. I'm on your left. I'm on your left.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No, right. Right. Yup.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey, man.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hey, Jordan, right.

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You ran into the engine.

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Is this where we scored?

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, right here.

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Alright.

21
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here we go.

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
One-zero.

23
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, no, no. They dropped the ball.

24
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Dropped it.

25
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
One-zero.

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah.

27
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, here we go. Here we go.

28
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Push it. Push it. Push it.

29
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Push it. Push it. Push it.

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Did you score it?

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Did you score it?

32
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Did you score it?

33
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Claim it.

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hey, this is the twilight. Ready?

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Claim it.

36
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah.

37
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah.

39
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Thank you.

40
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I only tried for the Eagles. I dropped the one in from the half. It was like, ooh.

41
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I had Kevin Swordsman behind me. He was about 390 pounds.

42
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We pushed you in?

43
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Took credit for it.

44
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Of course he did.

45
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hey, what's the score?

46
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
One-one.

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
One-one.

48
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
One-one.

49
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
One-one.

50
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
One-one.

51
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
One-one.

52
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
One-one.

53
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
One-one.

54
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
One-one.

55
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
One-one.

56
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
One-one.

57
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
One-one.

58
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
One-one.

59
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
One-one.

60
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One-one.

61
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
One-one.

62
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
One-one.

63
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
One-one.

64
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
One-one.

65
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm dropping, I'm dropping.

66
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I got last, I got last.

67
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah, we're good.

68
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We're up, we're up, we're up.

69
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Get all the hard work, score the try.

70
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hold it.

71
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah.

72
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah.

73
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Nice, well done.

74
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Next group up.

75
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Holding.

76
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, right here.

77
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Back up, back up, back up.

78
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Go, go, go, go, pass, pass, that ball, that ball.

79
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

80
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You have one more attacker, one less defender.

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Holding.

82
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, right here.

83
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Thank you, Courtney.

84
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Come on, ball, ball, ball, ball.

85
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, fair enough.

86
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You got to come up to him tight.

87
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If you're defending, come on up.

88
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, real good drill.

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We don't say the word we're defending anymore.

90
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, we're attacking with that.

91
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're attacking without the ball.

92
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's a good one, that's a good one, yeah.

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're attacking without the ball.

94
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Attitude.

95
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That changes our defenses like this.

96
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So there's still a contest indeed for attacking without the ball.

97
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Here we go.

98
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, right here.

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Back at me.

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Good hands, Kyler.

101
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, that's a good one.

102
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Good shot.

103
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah.

104
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.

105
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Go up, up, up, up on D, up on D, up on D.

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Good boy.
