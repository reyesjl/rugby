1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Poor shit.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Seals, what drives them?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
They always have a plan.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And if the plan goes to shit, guess what they have?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Not a good plan.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So in a game like this, where you've got this and you're striking and you're coming in,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
you've got to get across, you've got a goal, you've got an objective, you have a plan.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey listen, if it comes to me, I'm going to pass it to you, I'm going to give it to them.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm old too, but hey, run towards the orange shorts because I think there's a little bit of a gap there.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It could be as on a rugby field, when you take your girlfriend out for a fucking night out,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
there's a plan, isn't there?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Because if there isn't, there's no fucking hoochie-coochie after the movie.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Have a plan.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, last one.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Get it, Frank.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Here, let me get a shot of you.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Did you have a perk on or what?

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, you did.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Right here.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Put a fly here, one here, one here, one there, and on that yellow guy.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's the thumbnail.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's the thumbnail.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Four players on each side here and then four players on the other side.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And...

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's the end of the video.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thanks for watching.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Bye.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Bye.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Bye.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Bye.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Bye.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Bye.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Bye.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Bye.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Bye.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Bye.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Bye.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Bye.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Bye.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Bye.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Bye.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Bye.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Bye.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Bye.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Bye.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Bye.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Bye.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Bye.
