Cross body. I can tell you all the pros do it. They do it religiously. David Havili's probably got the best pass in his world of rugby. He'll throw that ball 15, maybe 20. And it's not my concern. I've seen him do his training. He's just on. He just gets it. Everything just, when you get it, you're comfortable delivering it.

I don't want to show any of them who's kind of 50-50 on throwing the ball one way.
