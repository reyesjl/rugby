1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Don't swear at me.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, I'll go to the other side.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You're going to step in.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're going to take agency of any sport.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Keep your credit card on it.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Because they're just pulling you into an ambush.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you're not excited.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you're not excited, what are you doing?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's generally an exit.
