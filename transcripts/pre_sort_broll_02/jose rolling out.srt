1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Yeah, I got bronze in the 100 and silver in the 200.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,280
I lost to people over 30, so I got pretty humble.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,040
That's embarrassing.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,120
It is very embarrassing.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,440
I'm glad this is on tape.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,620
I hope he didn't do his knee.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,720
What'd you say?

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,740
That guy landed pretty hard.

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,960
I didn't even see it.

10
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,440
Oh my goodness, he rifled that.

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,560
Roll out really necessary.

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,360
Just get up there and play, man.

13
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,020
That's how you win.
