1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
What are they doing in a bit?

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,080
Do something artistic, everyone.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,200
Jump, I don't know.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,720
We have to record you sometimes.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,680
Yeah, me doing nothing.

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,600
Me.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,040
Like, we never take pictures of you.

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,840
Oh, that's OK.

9
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,480
When you come back to Australia.

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,000
I never really feel...

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,360
It'll be a while, I think, unfortunately.

12
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,040
Do you think next year?

13
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,880
Maybe, yeah.

14
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,040
I think at this point, maybe, like,

15
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,000
I'd probably be allowed to get back off the field

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,440
at the end of the year,

17
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,400
but we'd still want to be careful.

18
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,680
It just depends on getting yourself stronger.

19
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,280
But if you keep training, like, you'll come back way stronger.

20
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,320
Supposedly.

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,000
It's hard because, like, I felt like I was in really good shape before,

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,400
so it feels like what I would have to do to, like,

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,040
come back stronger would be, like, insane.

24
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,680
You'll get there.

25
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,600
You'll get there.

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,040
Yeah, I don't feel like I'm in a huge rush at the moment.
