1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
We're just the first one there to pick up the ball.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,820
Because we were so fast, that's why we were able to get to an edge.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,980
I think that's what we can translate to actual sevens.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:08,460
There's money.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,320
And then obviously we can keep running our queens and stuff, which I think will look good.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:12,980
Hi, Taki.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,140
You're famous.

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:15,280
You're famous.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,480
I think also someone's in the 45.

10
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,360
The running line?

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,140
You carrying the ball?

12
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,520
Look for the gas.

13
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,660
Fuck, it's on.

14
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,540
It doesn't have to be cold.

15
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,280
Yeah, yeah.

16
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,160
Like, the ball carrier will make the decision to give it to you or come in.
