00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,040
One million beers, please

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
50

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh

5
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,060
Whether you're part of the scrum or watching from the stands

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,760
That's our help with the trusted medical partner of Old Glory DC and you that's our help. It's how we treat people

00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,660
Not the one.

19
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,480

20
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,220
Knock on Utah.

21
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,160
Scrub to D.C.
