1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Two, so five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14 right now?

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,340
I believe so.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,200
And then are the other teams?

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,660
They only have one try.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,380
I hope so.

6
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,580
Jose got the one in the beginning.

7
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,160
I got the one on that side.

8
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:11,760
Okay.

9
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,520
They either have two or three tries right now.

10
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,520
No, I don't bother.

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,500
I don't bother.
