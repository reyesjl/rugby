1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
I don't know, I'm just, I like that.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,120
This is going to be your favorite team.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:03,840
I was new.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,160
That was great.

5
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,460
I played for them two years.

6
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,300
It was before the year they went to the Panthers.

7
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,100
I'm going to dub that.

8
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:09,940
He says it's shit.

9
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,180
I think they had a lot of weeks.

10
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, cut it.

11
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:12,800
Voiceover.

12
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,540
Voiceover.

13
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,100
Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,100
No, that's the problem.

15
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,260
Like, the main coach.

16
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,860
Oh, I'm going to kick off the left.
