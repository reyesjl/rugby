00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Angel, what keeps you out of me?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Baby, show me your love

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Angel, what keeps you out of me?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Angel, show me your love

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Angel, show me your love

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Angel, show me your love

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Angel, show me your love

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Angel, show me your love

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Girl, tell me, would you love me?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But it hurts me, love, love

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, my God

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Baby, tell me, would you love me?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello, it's my little brother.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's your brother? Oh shit, what's up?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is Jose, big Jose.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What's your brother's name?

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
His name's John, and that's his girlfriend.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What's up, John? I heard you were hitting Fortnite emotes.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, you hitting a Fortnite emote for the camera?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
See if I can get it, see if I can get it. Alright, go. Go, tell him to get it.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Tell camera man.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Come on!

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Chop chop!

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, he's camera shy.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's go.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You got another shower, that's right.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You brought me your wife?

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I remember Angela Marcos first.
