00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,920
Take them back to your table, try them, and then craft a potion for the judges.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,400
So we have to select without trying?

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,920
You have to select without trying.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,340
It's a buy before you try?

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,760
It's a buy before you try.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,180
It's a buy before you try.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
Okay, team huddle, wrap.

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,620
So, everyone please separate into your teams.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,340
Is everybody going at once?

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,840
One final note, one final note.

11
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:29,040
One way that you can add points to your total is by telling us a tale about your cocktail.
