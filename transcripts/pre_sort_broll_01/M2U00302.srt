1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,240
Oh, he's through.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,200
Oh, no way.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,280
That's a bad call.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,280
Oh, that's so unproppable.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,120
Was that an obstruction?

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,920
That was an obstruction.

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,240
Apparently.

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,520
I don't know.

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,560
That's a beautiful play.

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,360
That's a really nice play.

12
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,160
Yeah, it was a nice play.

13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,880
I didn't see it.

14
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,240
I didn't see it.

15
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,600
I was just watching the replay.

16
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,520
That's a great play.

17
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,560
That's a .

18
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,920
Oh, my gosh.

19
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,200
You got that on video, too, didn't you?

20
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,800
That was crazy.

21
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,720
Dude, put that on that kid's highway tape.

22
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,320
I will.

23
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,120
He's bringing it back.

24
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,400
Stops all the time.

25
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,520
Oh, he just threw it back.

26
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,640
Oh, he did the right good job.

27
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,200
Good throw.

28
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,700
Yeah.

29
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,520
Two, one.

30
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,000
Watch the middle.

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,960
Watch the middle.

32
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,680
I got you.

33
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,180
Come on.

34
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,680
Ready?

35
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,400
Ready?

36
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,680
Up.

37
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,180
Boom.

38
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,540
Three.

39
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,420
There you go.

40
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,920
Let's go.

41
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,940
.

42
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,040
Let's go.

43
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,620
Let's go.

44
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,700
Let's go.

45
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,860
One, two.

46
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,420
One more.

47
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,880
One more.

48
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,360
Ready?

49
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,640

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,140
Let's go.

51
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,620
Nice.

52
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,120
.

53
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,260
You call it fair at Mad Fox.

54
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,560
Jose, you want an Italian ice?

55
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,460
I was just going to buy one.

56
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,240
Yes, please.

57
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,080
I'll take one.

58
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,600
Well, then we open here.
