1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Gotcha.

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,200
If you've thrown already today, you don't get a warm-up.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,000
You just go.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,200
If you haven't thrown axes yet, you will get a warm-up.

5
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,700
I didn't throw.

6
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,200
It was somebody else.

7
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,500
And if you've thrown but you sucked in your warm-up,

8
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,000
another rebel.

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Good luck.

10
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,100
That's not on me.

11
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,700
Suck shit.

12
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,700
That was a good attempt.

13
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,200
Good attempt.

14
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,700
Good attempt.

15
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,700
Suck shit and die of the plague.

16
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,900
Eat porridge.

17
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,400
Eat porridge.

18
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,200
No, eat pool.

19
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,700
Eat porridge.

20
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,400
Eat pool.

21
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,600
Almost stuck.

22
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,800
Do you want to hear a more than slightly inappropriate story?

23
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,000
Warm-up.

24
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
OK, so the phrase.

25
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Here we go.

26
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes.

27
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,500
Come on.

28
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Woo.

29
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,500
Woo.

30
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Woo.

31
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,500
Woo.

32
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Woo.

33
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,500
That's one.

34
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,000
That's one.

35
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Let's go.

36
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,000
That's a three.

37
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,500
That's a three.

38
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,000
That's all.

39
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Three points.

40
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,000
Three points.

41
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,500
She's her.

42
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, it's three.

43
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,500
Ah.

44
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,000
She's her.

45
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,500
Bye, y'all.
