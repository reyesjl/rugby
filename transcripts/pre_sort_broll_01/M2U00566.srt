1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
Yes, we're here.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,680
Tell us your yarn of your potion.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,680
Before you, you find Malachite Mirabilis.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,680
Malachite Mirabilis, my favorite!

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,680
How did you know?

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,680
The one true potion that allows

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,680
lovers to release their woes

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,680
and find their one true love.

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,680
Oh!

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,680
Guinevere and Lancelot, Prince Charming

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,680
and Sleeping Beauty.

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,680
All peed in this?

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,680
Jealous!

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,680
The potion that has been used to awake lovers to one another for years

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,680
and grow and change and transform

16
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,680
through that love.

17
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,680
Malachite, the stone of transformation.

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,680
Often known to elicit feelings of joy

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,680
and allow you to be able to

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
release what ails you

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,680
and move to what will heal you.

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Let her cook!

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,680
And so when you drink this

24
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
not only will you be able to heal

25
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,680
from your trauma

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,680
and release what ails you

27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,680
but move towards the things that give you joy

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,680
and also it has

29
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
a side benefit

30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,680
of being able to

31
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
take the burden to God.

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,680
Wow, that's fantastic.

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,680
Jester, what did you offer to the team today?

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
I gave the good spirits to the

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
gods who gave us the wonderful ingredients.

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Failed wizard, what have you offered

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
the team?

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
So, I tried

39
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,680
to do a coin spell.

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
When you taste it, it might have worked a little bit

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
but my magic was not quite powerful enough.

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,680
So looking for a nice coppery flavor perhaps?

43
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
Perhaps, but

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
I was going for a freezing spell

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
and so it might be a little cheap.

46
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
It might be a little chilly

47
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
but I wasn't quite there

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
so try it before

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
the spell wears off.
