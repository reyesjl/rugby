1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Steady, steady, simple.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I was moving.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I looked like a dummy on camera.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Trying to catch powers and stuff.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So we're going to make a little waterfall.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That should be a good ending.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
High up.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Sunnyville.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We can see, that looks good.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, that looks good.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Ricky, that was real nice.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Sympathetic ball, sympathetic ball.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Sympathico! Nice!

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm far, I'm far, I'm far.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Big hit, big hit.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Might not be smart, but I'm pretty good.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Nice.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hands up and out, hands up and out.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Way to finish.
