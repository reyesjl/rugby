1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
A humble peasant.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
A king like this would never fall for me.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I can't hear you!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You gotta cheat for the audience!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A scoundrel and a peasant.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
A scoundrel and a peasant.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
A humble, gorgeous king would never be with me.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Of course he would love a lovely princess like so.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Of course he would love a lovely princess like so.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What would I do to have this king love me back?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What would I do to have this king love me back?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'll never know, but I don't think it will happen in this lifetime.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'll never know, but I don't think it will happen in this lifetime.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You'll never see me!

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You'll never see me!

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, mirror, mirror on the wall,

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Who's the fairest peasant of them all?

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Who's the fairest peasant of them all?

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's Towers the Peasant.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Towers the Peasant.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I love how hot and sweaty and dirty he gets in the fields.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I love how hot and sweaty and dirty he gets in the fields.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I watched from my castle tower

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I watched from my castle tower

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and just could not control myself.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But alas,

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I cannot tell the world.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I cannot tell the world.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I cannot tell the world.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I cannot tell the world.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How dare he?

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How dare he?

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I love him,

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but he will not return my affections,

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
let alone the mirror it says

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
that he may love me,

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but I know this not to be true.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I know that only

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
he loves me.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I know that only he loves me.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I know that I love their friends.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
However, I know

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
he loves me not.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Or he loves me nay.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Potentially. I don't know.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Potentially everybody loves each other, but not me.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Potentially everybody loves each other, but not me.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That could be it as well.

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I only love peasant powers.

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I only love peasant powers.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My humble king.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But we ask, we all look in this mirror,

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
who is it that we see

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
our true love be?

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I see him.

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I see him.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I see him.

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I see him.

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The glorious king.

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The glorious king.

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Of course.

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Of course.

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Kiss!

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Kiss!

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Kiss!

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Kiss!

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Reality is mainly

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but the same.

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
For everyone, there's

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
always the same reality.

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah.

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh!

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Straight!

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh my!

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
A strong finish indeed.

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Very well.
