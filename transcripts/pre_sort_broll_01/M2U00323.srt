1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,020
Are you recording this right now?

2
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,580
Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,960
What's up?

4
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,120
Gentlemen.

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,720
How's it going?

6
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,480
Good to have you.

7
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,180
What's up?

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,740
How's it going?

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,260
Are you going to dab me up?

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,740
Is that allowed?

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,040
Good, good.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,560
How about yourself?

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,840
I know.

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,260
Me, too.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,260
Me, too.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,840
Good boot.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,340
Oh, that's not my tee.

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,640
That was a good kick, though.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,440
That was a good kick.

20
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,540
Good chase.

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,140
Guess how many share bars Paveridge has had.

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:08,960
That team's a good pair.

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,340
He's about to get...

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,960
Two.

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,480
He's about to go for his third.

26
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,340
That's good.

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,420
Keeping him in business, man.

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,140
They're five hours.

29
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,060
That's a lot of work.

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,400
Is this a gun?

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,400
That's a steel gun.

32
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,340
Oh, yeah.

33
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,120
Oh, right.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,640
Oh, yeah, yo.

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,360
Are you kidding me?

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,140
Dude, that's so stupid.

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,200
Yeah, that was not right.

38
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,420
That was like forward pace.

39
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,000
Monkeys!

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,680
Watch this.

41
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,320
They're going to go left here.

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,120
Oh, they didn't.

43
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,140
They actually went the right way.

44
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,860
A couple monkeys.

45
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,880
I need to get low again.

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
I need to get low again.

47
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,020
Oh.

48
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,820
Oh, great tackle.

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,260
Who was that?

50
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,800
That was great.

51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,940
That's such a...

52
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,620
That's a fun one.

53
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,100
I do that still.

54
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,500
Let's go, Billy.
