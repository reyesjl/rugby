1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
Oh, we're so weary. We've been talking our potions this way and that for weeks now, and we're so tired.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,740
We've come to this town for a little thing called Constantinople.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:24,020
I've heard you are the governor and his rat, and we are here to present you our potions in the hope that you will buy them.

4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,680
Before I can taste your potions, I must ask, why is it Constantinople and not Istanbul?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,320
Because we're in the renaissance period, that is how history works.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,760
That historian checks out.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,040
What do these potions do?

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:47,140
Well, so, we knew a number of towns ago, but there were signs that were printed, and we've lost them in the wind.

9
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:53,200
And now we do not know what the potions do, and they're all a very similar color, as you can see.

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,160
But we know that they all do good things.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,960
Juggle them!

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,360
Juggle them!

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:58,880
Juggle!

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,480
Juggle!

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:00:59,960
Juggle!

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,420
Let's throw the tomatoes.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,600
Let's throw the tomatoes.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,640
You're going to let me try before you buy.

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,860
Do you really need potions?

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,580
I believe we do need potions.

21
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:13,060
One is for healing, one is for love, and one is explosive.

22
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,940
And the choice is yours.

23
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,300
Here we go.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,100
Oh my god, it wasn't the explosive one.

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,060
It's clearly not the explosive one.

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,580
Let's do that a couple more times.

27
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,500
Oh my god.

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,060
Oh my god.

29
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,620
Time!

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,060
Time!

31
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,760
I would like to taste first.

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,260
Time!

33
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:36,880
I, Sir Rick of the Rugby, with a name that's given to a dickhead who doesn't know how to taste potions,

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,360
That guy obviously sucks.

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,260
would like to try all the same.

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,280
Ah, this is not a potion of protection.

37
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,220
It's a potion of healing, or also of healing, from unoriginal, unspired craftsmen.

38
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:51,460
Okay, stop.

39
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,640
I would just have to give it a taste.

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,940
Here it goes.

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,640
Are you going to eat those?

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:58,980
I'm going to show it to you.

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,640
Whoa.

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,260
I feel quite attracted to you, my friend.

45
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,760
I'm going to give you the potion.

46
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,760
I'm not trying it, but I could be your king tonight.

47
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,260
I'm going to give you the potion.

48
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,260
Well, let's try the last one.

49
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,260
Jeez, there's only one left.

50
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,260
Well, we have to be sure.

51
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,260
I suggest you try it.

52
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,260
We will, we will, we will observe at a safe distance.

53
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,260
I, Sir Rick the Foolhardy, who could not taste his way out of a potion,

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,260
will give you a wet paper bag, and I'll see if this shall explode outside of setback.

55
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
And they're all dead.

56
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Bravo!

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
Bravo!
