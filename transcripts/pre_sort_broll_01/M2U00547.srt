1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's a little bit overworked.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That'll be a try.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
No, it's not a try.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
God would be offended.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Alright.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Andy, keep up the helpful commentary,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
my man.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hey, don't do that. Do it better.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Nice!

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So Rick, does it have to stick to count?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay, but if something else knocks it off,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
it still counts.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The initial stick counts your points.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
She put a bag on my head. Still counts.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
He has not thrown yet.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No, I got it.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I thought you might get it.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We're gonna get three throws each that count.
