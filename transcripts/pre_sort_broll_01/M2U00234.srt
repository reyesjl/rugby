1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
Best revenge, no stress, I still ain't missed

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,860
I could've got round there, put it on social media, I ruined his cred

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,220
Could've grabbed a haba, put two in his head, but I let God do it instead

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,900
A dumb man wrong, where are they now? Nowhere to be seen

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,360
Where they at? The power's strong, where am I now?

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,100
I've been in the charts for 18 weeks

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,080
My bro stayin' off him right now, make man tap out

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,360
But he stay on his team like a beep

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,300
Bro, I know it's long time, no see, but I'm here whenever you need

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,560
Sat in a band, no watches, not one good for my mental health

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,840
The things I see on a daily basis be on a daily melt

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,160
Why the hell would I dwell on the past when I make profit off the pain I felt?

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,500
How the fuck these guys gonna date these girls when they can't even pay for themselves?

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,300
Few of these females left me on red back then, but look, now I bet they regret it

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,260
They used to ask what I do for a living, I said that I work in a chemist

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,900
I had no money, I weren't embarrassed, I'm doing that road in my Toyota Yaris

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,720
C-Squad late, tryna cut through traffic, rule number one, don't panic

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,060
I know they hate it, they can't ignore me, I'm all over London town

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,820
It's funny to think that I went OT when I was 16 for a hundred pounds

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,820
I get Kyalizia now, true, L-Y-M-E, don't run them

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,080
I couldn't care less what they say on their blogs as long as my mum's eat proud

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,040
I keep on telling the yambos, brand on, quick cars all about
