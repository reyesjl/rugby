1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Can you go buy me a beer at the Vic?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We're going to the Vic?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Beer at the Vic.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Beer at the Vic.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
At the Vic, yeah, we're going to the Vic.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Not Mad Hatter's.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Because if we go to Mad Hatter's, we're not going home, son.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I need to go home.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Dude, what's your mom

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
going to say when she sees this?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, is this going to

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Miss Bowers? That's my boy!

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Is this going to Miss Bowers?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Is this going to Miss Bowers?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's why I can't read it.
