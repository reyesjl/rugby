1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,640
You need footage.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,200
You need footage, bro, so people don't...

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
Look at this.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,200
Damn, these kids just got trucked.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,600
That's pretty brutal.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
They've never beat us before, I don't blame them.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Bro.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Damn.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's tough.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Sad day to be an alumni right now.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Talk to somebody, I think.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I must see if Will can sneak us a couple pizzas.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That was a win or a go, Joe.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
See, this is one of the years in my life.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Like, I'm never gonna go to a college football hotel.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And they're gonna have multiple losses.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The high school system's weird.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You get your invite based on the year before.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The year before.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So it's like, I think two people are gonna win in high school.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Basically.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You know.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It goes.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's kinda like a monopoly.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A pace!

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That was a bad one.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That wasn't even my day.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But admittedly I waited a day for this trip.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Being the captain?

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
수를.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:51,920
And to be

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
seviable.

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
Oh.

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Oh.

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
That's such horror.

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,000
It is kinda sick.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That is kinda sick.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:17,760
That's a huge win for them, they've never done that shit before, so are you gonna repose

40
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
for Memorial Day or what?

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Yeah, I'm down.

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
Are you down?

43
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
No, Memorial Day Beach.

44
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
I'm down.

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:31,680
Do you think they're gonna take it off Friday?
