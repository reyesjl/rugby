1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right, I'll go step first.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh, that's thumbnail.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Come on. No, you're in the middle, Powers. You're still in the middle.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ooh.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Alex, you can't let him off easy.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He's got to redeem himself.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Ah, it's looking good, guys.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hell yeah.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There's no rhyme or reason here.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yellow card.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No shame in the man.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Dude, I feel like it's better than it was, than it's been in the last few.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Bigger progress the first step.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Like I would normally run.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Come on.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And then if you need to slow the feet.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Nice hands.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's finish. Let's finish.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Nice. Good ball. Good timing.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Nice, Joe. Way to dummy.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Shit, I want the ball, damn it.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Go, go.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Go, go.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Ready, Trevor?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Whoever you want. Your choice.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Right here.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's do it.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Nice.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now, there you go.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You got it, I got it, I got it!

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I got it, I got it, I got it!

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, Kenny.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yep!

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Nice try, Kenny.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hey.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Never a shot.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, fuck you, Kenny.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Come on, good game.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Good.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I think he's a little dizzy out there.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah, Harry, I'm holding, man.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm all day!

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Nice, guys.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
All right, guys.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Can we pitch now?

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All right, guys.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's a nice finish.
