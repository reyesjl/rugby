1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
We'll try and get an early catch and show what a transfer looks like, right?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,780
Right, so, early.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,440
It wasn't very good, but the premise being that if the catch is here and not here,

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,540
it'll just be bad.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,320
Just delay your feet a second, yep.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,560
It's a little space.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,340
Yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,300
So, there's multiple things that are going wrong with all of us, right?

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,400
So, delaying your feet is definitely one.

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,180
So, that's a takeaway.

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:37,380
The other takeaway is really concentrate as you can to catch it here, latest here, so you can distribute a lot here, a lot up here, hopefully it hits yourself.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,120
And just to be clear before we move on, what does late feet mean?

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,460
Like, what are we actually saying there?

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,820
You see the person in front of you, you see the back, you see their number, then you can advance.

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,440
If you're moving up too quickly, then you're not giving yourself time to catch a transfer, you're putting yourself under more pressure than you need.

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,500
Exactly right, exactly right.

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,020
And if I take...
