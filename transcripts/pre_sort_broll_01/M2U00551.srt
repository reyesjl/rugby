1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,240
It fell off! It doesn't count!

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,760
19. 19. 19.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,420
She was 100% on JD.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,000
Ricky, it fell off! She had 1 in 3.

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,500
Ricky!

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,880
1 in 4 is 19.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,080
The bullseye is 20.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,540
Oh, okay.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,120
That was not what was advertised earlier, I feel like.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,640
The bullseye is harder to hit than JD Van's head.

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,480
You hit the bullseye, it's 20.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,260
Ricky, she had 15, 1 in 4.

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,940
On the board, and 3.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:38,600
1.

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,280
19.

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,000
Thank you.

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,740
I was like, dude, I'm not worried about this.

18
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,800
I heard you were worried about this.

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,400
I thought JD was 10.

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,660
I got excited, you know.

21
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,900
It can be 15.

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,240
What?

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,560
So between the first two people on our team, we got that.

24
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,900
That shot right there would be so sick.

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,360
Oh my god.

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
Yeah, Bowen could never.

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,120
All right, keep them.

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
All right.

29
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Keep them alive.

30
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
Keep them alive.

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Good job.

32
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Yes, yes.

33
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Can't just be that good at something, man.

34
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
It's not cool.

35
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Give it all the event.

36
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Yeah.

37
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,120
All right.

38
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
We'll take one.

39
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Oh!

40
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Oh, he does it.

41
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
I did it.

42
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
That's like a rat tap.

43
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Rats doing that.

44
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
Dude.

45
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
That's good for safety.

46
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
That's enough.

47
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
That's enough.

48
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,120
That's enough.

49
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
That's enough.

50
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
That's enough.

51
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
That's enough.

52
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
That's enough.

53
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
That's enough.

54
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
I'm done.

55
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
I'm done.

56
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
I'm done.

57
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Thank you.

58
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Thank you.

59
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
All right.

60
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Sure.

61
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
Thank you.

62
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
Thank you.
