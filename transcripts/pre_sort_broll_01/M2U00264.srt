1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
I really want to see.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,600
I'm a jester.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,460
Brandon, what sound does a horse make?

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,500
Oh no, I've never heard of it.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,060
It sounds like this.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,880
So cute.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,540
Alright, leave enough hay for the others.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,180
Jesus.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,980
It's just as healthy as Jacob Powers.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,620
For real.

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,300
I'm going to close up on its Kenny.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,660
Probably got that for free.

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,240
The hay.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,560
Oh, there we go.

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,020
I'm going to push his head out.

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,500
He's like, what the fuck are you guys looking at?

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,500
We basically own the home.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,260
Do we?

19
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,320
I mean...
