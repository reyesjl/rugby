1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
Katelyn's just not comfortable with it.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,280
Exactly. I do not need that whole video. Stop.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,280
No, that's a great clip. Click that. Click that. Check.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,160
What were you talking about?

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,120
Uh, Cuddy, you're, uh, you know, my majestic new main.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,840
You're still, uh,

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,680
faithfully employed, right?

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,920
The DOD isn't taking care of you, right?

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,280
Mom, I'm not a CEO, right?

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,640
That's what I'm saying.

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,840
Faithfully employed.

12
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,320
It was probably a choice of the law.

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,360
She's thinking about it.

14
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,800
She bugged off the lighthouse, right?

15
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,080
So it's because I'm in college for the lighthouse.

16
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,080
That's a good question.

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,080
I wish you were in my band.

18
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,080
I wish you were in my band.

19
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,080
I wish you were in my band.

20
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,080
So she's a real nice guy.

21
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,080
I'm looking for a special offer.

22
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,080
I wish you wouldn't start a career

23
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,080
until the lighthouse lights is on

24
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
and you have people visiting your church.

25
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,080
I don't believe in the current administration's agenda.

26
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,080
I'm sure it was published

27
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,080
against the current administration's agenda.

28
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,080
Yeah, I was going to say, I thought you did a lot of research.

29
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,640
Did you do a lot of research?

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,920
Like, there's a good chance

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,920
she doesn't have much of a choice in the future.

32
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,920
She could, I believe, like, turn.

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,920
That would be another problem.

34
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,920
Someone bring him balls or should I get more money?

35
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Ah, fuck!

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,720
Who has the ball bag?

37
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Tyrus, do you have the ball bag?

38
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
It's right there.

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
It's that trash bag.

40
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
She's super smart.

41
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
She'll get the job.

42
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
We could live off my salary for a while.

43
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
Forever.

44
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,920
Then he's got...

45
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,920
We could go on trips and shit, you know?

46
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Like, I wouldn't be going to Miami if we were a single-income household.

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
But, yeah.

48
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Dinner on...
