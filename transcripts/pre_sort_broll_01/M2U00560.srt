1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Plum carrot.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It smells terrible.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Oh, shit.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Plum carrot.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let me know, guys.

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Just chill.

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Plum carrot.

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What's this?

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Lemon.

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh, that's carrot juice, you said?

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We're running out of time.

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come back for the condiments.

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Plum carrot.

14
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Go off.

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Go to your table.

16
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Try what you have.

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Taste test them.

18
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is frozen.

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So we can taste it?

20
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay.

21
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Wait, we can taste it?

22
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, you have to taste it.

23
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Is everyone comfortable?

24
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Wait, yeah.

25
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're missing one.

26
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
All right.

27
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Which one do we want?

28
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What would you like?

29
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
There you go.

30
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Maybe some mint?

31
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Maybe some mint as well?

32
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Can you bake for us in three minutes?

33
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What?

34
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Sorry, bake for us in three minutes.

35
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay.

36
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, this is the first.

37
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is the first.

38
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
King and queen, king and queen in three.

39
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
May I touch you for a second?

40
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Which one did you get?

41
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Holy God.

42
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We're going to have to get a little bit of a shake.

43
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay.

44
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We're going to have to get a little bit of a shake.

45
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay.

46
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's do this.

47
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay.

48
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So, you guys have to go.

49
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So, I'm going to have to go.

50
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

51
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
All right.

52
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So, we're going to have to go.

53
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, so we're going to have to go.

54
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay.

55
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So, we're going to have to go.

56
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

57
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,760
Who wants to do that?

58
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
Oh, hey, guys.

59
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,960
What would you like?

60
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,480
You can be gone, peasant.

61
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
55 seconds.

62
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,780
The king and queen.
