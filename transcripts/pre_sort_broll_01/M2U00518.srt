00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Uh, that had to be 4-B. We were not very good when I was there.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I think we were 1-0 right?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't know.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, you've got 9 on. I just noticed that.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Where's the viewpoint?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Right here, right?
