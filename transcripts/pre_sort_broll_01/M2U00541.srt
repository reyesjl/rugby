Hey!

Congrats.

00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Yeah, thanks.

Cheers.

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Cheers.

00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,500
I mean, bummers.

8
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,000
Bummers.

9
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How are us to sell them?

10
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You don't even dump shit like this.

11
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey, that's hot.

12
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah, that.

13
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Cast a spell. Cast a spell.

14
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm like, how does this feel?

15
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's longer than I think it is.

16
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Boo-brah-da-nooom.

17
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Last verse.

18
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're going to check out some bongos.

19
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But you know what?

20
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's what we're going to do.

21
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're going to check out some bongos.

22
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Not bad.

23
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That is not bad.

24
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But I'm always, I'm like Ben on the hunt for seconds of furniture.

25
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm just kidding.

26
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm just kidding.

27
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm just kidding.

28
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Lord has blessed us with a water mask.

29
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why is it?

30
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Alright, who casted a freezing spell?

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The wench throws the axe.

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's cold.

33
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's still cold.

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000

35
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
