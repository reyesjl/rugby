00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
When you pass me the ball, this is what Jose was talking about, yeah?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,140
If I catch the ball at the end of the ball, which I see people doing, and not correcting their hands.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,960
Or, conversely, Marlon, catching the ball at the end of the spheres, and trying to distribute it out like that.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,340
If I'm spin passing, I want one hand on the bottom third, one hand just bouncing,

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,420
and if I'm push passing, which means no spin, and I want my hands more central, here, right? Here.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,420
So what Jose was saying at the start, I'm shooting the ball,

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,720
and it's always weird finding people having to do your pass in a few of those days,

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,520
so you can get the ball away without too much difficulty.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,020
Good.
