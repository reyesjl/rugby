1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yeah, probably!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's not close!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey, let's go!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's crazy.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Did you just hear powers?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
He was bragging, he's like, dude, I probably...

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He's like, dude,

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I probably have more beers than all these kids can buy.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No, like...

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, probably.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That was like, individually.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, individually.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I know.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Me too, all of us.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, get off!

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Get off!

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't know.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Honestly, yeah.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Do you want an award or something?

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What was the point of saying that?

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No, I was just like, putting it in perspective.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They'll say it, and it's like...

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, no, you're right.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I see where you're coming from.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
They probably never thought that.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Another...

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, move it, move it, move it!

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, move it, move it, move it!

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We need help over here!

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Whatever, sir.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Did the ref change?

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm pretty sure he did.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't yell at me.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm pretty sure he did.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No.
