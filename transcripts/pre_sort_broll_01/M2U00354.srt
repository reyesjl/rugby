1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
No, you can't.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Score!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Just go around, everybody flub, flub, flub, flub, flub.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
They were too slow.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They need quicker rocks.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Dude, their defense is firing on them.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They need to, they have no, it's literally, they have nothing slow in their defense now.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's a way too flabby defense.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why would you do that?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Why would you do that?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That was a horrible decision.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Did you steal that?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, took the balls out.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He just went around and around.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I said the ball was out.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Spin it now.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Spin it.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Get through.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Pop it.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, my God, guys.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's selfish.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's really selfish.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He's playing it safe.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
He's playing it safe.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Just another rock.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Just go.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
There we go.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go quick.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Go quick.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They're out.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's close.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's hard.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
For sure.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They can score.

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They can still score here, though.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, you're right.

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I know.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
With only seven, I think it's a good one.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
At least it looks better.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That looks just fine.

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That looks just fine.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, you can't win them all.

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But let's see.

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's see if you can get a try.

45
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Come on, boys.

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Nice.

47
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Good take.

48
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Quick.

49
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Quick.

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You've got to run a line right to the post.

51
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You have to go now, guys.

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Urgency.

53
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Go.

54
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Bro, the scrum half is way too quiet.

55
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, man.

56
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Too hot.

57
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, no.

58
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why?

59
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why?

60
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Why?

61
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why?

62
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Why?

63
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why?

64
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Why?

65
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why?

66
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Why?

67
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why?

68
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why?

69
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why?

70
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Why?

71
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why?

72
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why?

73
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why?

74
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why?

75
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why?

76
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why?

77
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why?

78
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What?

79
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why?

80
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why?

81
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why?

82
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Why?

83
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why?

84
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, this you can smell it.

85
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's the man.

86
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's the it's the 농 candy.

87
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Great.

88
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's right.

89
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's right.

90
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah.

91
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's gum.

92
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's gum.

93
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's a good first game, bro.

94
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's a good game.

95
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's another good game.

96
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Wow.

97
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's crazy.

98
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, yeah, it's a good game right.

99
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Happy Thanksgiving.

100
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can't believe that.
