1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Rosemary. Helping us gather the, uh, the garnishes.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There's gonna be some rosemary.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Natural. Organic. Cold, right?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Very cold, Wizard.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, thank you, thank you.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Very cold.

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Good job.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Drink around. Use the rosemary as a filter.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There's a technique.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Mmm.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Mmm.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Mmm.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's right. Mmm.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Mmm.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And we all believe you.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My lord, I feel refreshed.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Huzzah!

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The judges will confer and render our verdicts momentarily.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Please, drink from each other's chalices.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Make merry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, this shall be...
