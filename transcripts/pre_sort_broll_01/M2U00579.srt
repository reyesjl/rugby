1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Exactly.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We'll be fine.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I don't know, wouldn't it be crazy if our story included, like, minks?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
No, that's our thing. I think it's totally good.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
For the Red Wolves,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the prompt is thus.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
An enchanted mirror

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
is showing everyone

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
a different version of reality.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You must figure out what's true

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
before someone gets damaged.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Wow.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Begin!

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's high tension.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Power's going home.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He's cooked, chat. He's cooked.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Ricky, this is Power's

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
D&D arc.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is where it starts.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's gotta start somewhere.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The ripped shirt.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's what it was.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thank you.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's killing me.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's so hard to guess. Is it Macarena?

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Is it Brown Eyed Peas?

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Is it Macarena?

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What a crazy playlist.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's so funny. Oh my god.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Like, on the way here, I looked up medieval

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
on Spotify, and it came up, and I was like,

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was like, what?

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I was like, who made this? It's insane.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Every song. People who are passionate about it.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I know. They love it.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm gonna be the one to write the medieval version.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm gonna do it.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And more boldly, someone said that about the Macarena.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And they did it.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And they did it perfectly.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I mean, I could have done it better.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I know.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's so good.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You have 25 seconds,

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
peasants.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Would you like to gather any

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
props, perhaps?

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What?
