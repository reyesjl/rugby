1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
What's really important is for this second guy to, one, not leave early,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,580
but, two, almost creep the space a little bit closer to this first receiver.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,880
Because when I go off and Dom's a little bit tighter here, this guy's on an island.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,700
He has to make a decision whether he's going after Dom or leaving the space open.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,100
So just try that.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,080
Everybody got that?

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,400
Yeah.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,040
All right.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,680
Yeah, Rick.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,640
No over-the-top balls.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,680
Everything's got to be before.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,980
Nice, Dom.

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,460
Well done, Dom.

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,600
Beautiful.

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,620
Nice, Ricky.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,860
Well done, Ricky.

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,340
Way to finish, Allie.

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,820
Great hands, Kenny.

19
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,420
Hey.

20
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:52,780
Hey.

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,260
Nice and tight, nice and tight.

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:58,940
Nice.

23
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,560
Nice job, Mark.

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,440
Straight back, straight back.

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,800
Swap defense.

26
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,680
Swap defense.

27
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,760
Take yellow cards.

28
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,240
That's fine.

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,060
Me, me, me, me.

30
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,500
Great hands, Joe.

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,460
Lovely.

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,720
My turn.

33
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,540
My turn, my turn.

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,260
My turn, my turn.

35
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,340
Go middle, Allie.

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:26,740
Go carry.

37
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,940
My turn, my turn.

38
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:37,300
Watch out Joe. Oh my god, they missed a rep because of you.

39
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,100
Here, let's see that mustache again.

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,360
Nice! Good transfer!

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Oh, you do play sense. You are in sense.

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Swap!

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:17,360
Dickhead.

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Dickhead.

45
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:31,360
Go for the man, not the ball. Make a decision. Nice Tom. Great hands. Nice. Way to hold your depth Joe.

46
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Too late brother.

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
There was no defense there.

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Brennan held his feet. I was going to make that quick tap.

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Nice Robert.

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,360
Perk suck.

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,360
How are you sweating out here? It's freezing.

52
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Dude, focus. Here it comes.

53
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Commit one of the boys.

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Commit to a man.

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,360
Nice!

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,360
With your hands.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
Pull back. Pull back.

58
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Oh!

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Swap D!

60
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
What's behind you there Dylan?

61
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Just keep chatting defense, yeah?

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,360
Deep corey, deep corey, deep corey.

63
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Nice powers.

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Yeah, with me, with me.

65
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360
Yeah, we got three.

66
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Yeah, we got one.

67
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
Get down.

68
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Oh!

69
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Time you lost man there Kenny.

70
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Get in there.

71
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Get one!

72
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Get hands, get hands.

73
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Real deep, real deep.

74
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Two.

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Still holding, still holding.

76
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Yeah, go, go, go, go, go, go.

77
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Oh!

78
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Video!

79
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Turn, turn, turn. Next rep, next rep.

80
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
No, no, you're good.

81
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,360
They're pushing though.

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Alex is an overachiever.

83
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Dummy Alex.

84
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
One more.

85
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
That was just a little forward.

86
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Dummy him if you get the ball on the way back.

87
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
I'll give it a look. I'll give it a look.

88
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
He's going to go so fast.

89
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
Got his arm.

90
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Got his arm.

91
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm coming in flat, bro.

92
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
I'm out.

93
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
You're three.

94
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
I'm two back.

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,360
Hey!
