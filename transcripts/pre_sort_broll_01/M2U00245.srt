1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
In this drill, that's an incorrect rep.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Why is it an incorrect rep if I catch it here?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Because you have to catch out of it.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You really sort of have to transfer the ball when you've got no reason.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Right?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to catch the ball here, I can transfer it straight across.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Right?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, I said it too...

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Sorry, the principle being the catch, not the...

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first power's not going to tell you.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I mean...

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Guys, that's what he's coached for.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Kenny on three.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, easy, easy, hold on.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Steady, steady, steady.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Who's here, who's here, who's here?
