00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,540
To protect him from witches, and his first act as king was to have the Potion Master brew this, but before one sip could touch his lips, the witch's dust had cursed him, and we all know his unfortuitous end.

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,400
Please, envy and enjoy the protection from the magical makers in this neighborhood.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,840
Oh, they just won the presentation.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,360
I heard no mention of making that spot.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:23,740
I know.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,400
Oh, that's good.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:36,840
Yes, it was great.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,220
Non-witchy.

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,280
I sense some lavender here, which was not on the table.

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,560
Where did you get this lavender, Fred?

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,820
I don't know over there.

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,440
I do not believe it was specified in the rules that we were limited to ingredients on the table.

13
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,860
Very, very impressive foraging capabilities.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,820
I commend you.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,260
It was hand-smoked by the potion makers.

16
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,600
Oh, very light.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,480
It tastes of moonlight.

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,220
And should we test the healing properties while this dagger here is on?

19
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,660
It shall not.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,880
Well done.

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,560
I'll trade that.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,640
That was pretty good.

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,140
Good job, guys.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,580
That was good.

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,080
That was good.
