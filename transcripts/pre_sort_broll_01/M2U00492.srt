00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
A lot of the time, you're not dropping your hips down low enough, and you're just coming right at the circle.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,240
You've got to be a high tap to happen below the hip.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,780
I've been accused of this multiple times.

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,580
Drop those hips.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,560
Then come back up after you drop those hips, look at the leg, back with drive circle.
