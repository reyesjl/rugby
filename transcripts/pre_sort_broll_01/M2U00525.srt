1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to show up to Can-Am, barely stretched, have a couple light beers, and just win the final.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,060
Nah, bro, only white planes lose the final.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,780
We asked them if they could play, but they only accepted if we traveled up or not.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,280
Good. I would be sick that day.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,000
You playing threes?

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,920
I want three touches. Can we play against Sahan?

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,940
No, I don't want to get beat up either.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,580
Jose, what do you think?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,320
Today? If they want it.

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,200
We need our opposition.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,060
That would actually be very good training for us.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,220
I don't know what the fuck else we'd be doing.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,880
No, we're going to do...

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,340
Four to threes.

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:42,740
Boom.

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,920
Oh, RIP Fiji. What's today's date?

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,640
July 24th. RIP Fiji.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,620
What? What happened?

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:55,660
He died.

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,120
RIP Chuck Mangino.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,200
The singer?

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,340
Fiji?

23
00:00:59,660 --> 00:00:59,980
Oh!

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,300
Oh, sweet darlin'.

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,880
You know that song?

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,560
What did I do to deserve you?

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,680
I know Crazy Prince. I know Iron Man.

28
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,620
Oh, he died too.

29
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,200
That's a crazy trio to be hanging out in heaven right now.

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,840
Ozzy Osbourne.

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,140
They rockin'. They're definitely fuckin' rockin' right now.

32
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,360
Ozzy Osbourne, Fiji, and...

33
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,460
Dude, Chuck Mangino.
