1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
And I see some people cheering for it, which is okay, because I get it a wee bit, but what's happening is, we walk this through, I'm second, you're first, you're first offender, you're second offender, sellers, right?

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:20,840
So just walk into the line, right? Walk into the line, give me the pass. I'm catching it here, right? And I'm seeing multiple people coming around here and trying to give this offload.

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,400
Is that a success? If that goes well, is that a success or failure in the context of what we're working on?

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,480
Why is it a failure? What went wrong?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,720
I caught it here. I can't reload. I mean, unless I'm tired from this crab hand coming like this. I'm not going to be able to generate any force, because I have to reload.

6
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:48,240
And because I don't feel comfortable reloading, or because some of you are still trying to get your hands on the ball to spin it, which takes forever, you're then forced to come here, or just shovel it like shit, like across.

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,880
So if we come again, don't put your shoulder on my head, please.

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:51,860
Hold.
