1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ends the heartache and the thousand naturals thoughts that flesh their sleep

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
To the consummations about these we wish to die

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
To sleep, to sleep, perchance to dream, aye, there's the rub

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
When we have shuffled off this mortal toil must give us pause

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There's the respect that makes calamity of so long life

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
For who would bear the wits and scorns of time

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The oppressor's rawness, the proud man's contumely

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The pangs of despised love, the laws of delay

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The insolence of office and the spurns

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That gish and merit of the unworthy takes

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When he himself might in quietus make with a bare body

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who would marvel there to grunt and sweat under a weary life

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But that the dredge of something after death

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That undiscovered country from before no traveller returns

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Than fly to others that we know not of

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And thus the native true of resolution is sick in o'er

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
With the pale cast of thought

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And enterprises of great pith and moment

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
With disregard their currents turn awry

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And cease the name of action

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you very much!
