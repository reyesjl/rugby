00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, so Ricky went out to get beer. He's coming back. I have a cake. It's his birthday in a week and a half.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So I think when he comes back we should all shout surprise and then we should make him blow out candles on a cake.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's so cute. Okay. Where should we all be gathered?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He can go upstairs. We can gather upstairs.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Is he going to go outside?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No, I think we'll just do it inside. I think he just comes in, holds his beer, we shout surprise, and we make him blow out candles.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
On the cake? You said cake?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, I thought you said cake.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If we all hide outside in the backyard.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I was like a little bit alright.
