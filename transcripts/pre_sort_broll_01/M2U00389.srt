1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
Something about seeing, like, professional athletes in the setting, like, not so professional, like, this is very funny to me.

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,760
The judge's position is just, like...

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:23,180
And the fact we play with, like, some of these dudes is also, like, weird.

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:23,900
Exactly.

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,980
That's a nice scrum right there.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,780
Go, Louto.

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,720
That's Owen's dream right there.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
That's Owen's dream.

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,420
Oh, you felt my hallucinator.

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,580
Knock on wood.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
Is this a car, okay?

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,080
It's a car.

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,140
He's, like, clutching himself all the time.

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:54,460
What?
