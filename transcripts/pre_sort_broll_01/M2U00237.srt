00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
No, we don't need them, bro.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm back in office full-time.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That's real.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Monday?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Sunday.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Weren't you already in the office most days?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, I was only 60%.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ah!
