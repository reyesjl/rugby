1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What is that?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is the car.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What year is that?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is the year that I did 23.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'll play that year.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, that was the year.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The year of the leg.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Big earphones.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This has got big end of watch mics to it.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Dude.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The handy cam.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh yeah, it's sick. The phone comes up.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, he doesn't know our channel. Go on YouTube.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Look up First 5 Rugby.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I won't, but I'll say that I will.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I've seen big Cloverfield bottles.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, I've seen one of those too.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You haven't seen them?

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No, I haven't.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, I hated that movie.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
False advertising.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Not a single clover in the entire film.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If someone would nominally

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Irish heritage, I'm offended.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The monster's name was Clover.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You know, I didn't really get that.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I didn't think it came across clearly.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Da-da.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Get on the floor.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh.
