1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Mmm.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Which was actually spread by rats!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
People actually used to believe they were spread by bees.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So what they had to do was develop a potion to cure the minks of the black plague.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're spreading it around, because as we know, minks were everywhere back in the Middle Times.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So what we had to do was create this mink juice elixir.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Mink juice elixir, very good.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now, what we found out though was that it doesn't work on minks.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
However, it has incredible healing properties for humans.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You feel lighter, you feel happier, you feel closer to Jesus, or further away, honestly, whichever one you want.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You get what you want.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Fascinating.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, me first?
