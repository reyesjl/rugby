1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Judges will then render their judgments from over there.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
May they speak or is it silent?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They may speak!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They may speak!

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
They must speak.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Everyone has to speak.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No silent parts.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is coordinating the silence speaking?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
No.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Correct.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We have three minutes.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Two.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
One minute to wrap them up.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We do need, however, before we begin, we do need scorecards for the judges.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Four.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Four minutes, they don't know.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Four minutes.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What's up?

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Four minutes?

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The what?

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The minimum number of minutes.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Four minutes?

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's a whole piece of paper.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's a long list of words.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No.

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We need scorecards.

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I can think of one thing to say right now.
